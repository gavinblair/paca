- preload scenes and other images
- important: when you lose a tool, select the eye
- UI: left click = use current tool, right click = use hand (or eye?)
- important: double click to exit immediately (exits we've already been to)
- ios: tiptap to move - single tap only for buttons
- soon: elevation (stairs)

maybe
- zoom? (for walking far away) (like elevation, it's still 2D)
- follow the camera (wide scenes) ?
- shaky camera (a la sword and sworcery) ?
