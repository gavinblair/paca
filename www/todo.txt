- double click to exit immediately (exits we've already been to)
- per-scene character speed
- use buttons to close dialog, no other way to close
- ios: tiptap to move - single tap only for buttons
- elevation (stairs)

maybe
- follow the camera (wide scenes) ?
- shaky camera (a la sword and sworcery) ?
